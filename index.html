      <p><b>Extremely Red Quasars (ERQ)</b> </p>
      <p>Dust obscured quasars are believed to be in a young stage of quasar/galaxy evolution, where
          quasar feedback can be more important for driving blowouts and disrupting star formation in
          their host galaxies. A remarkable population of luminous, extremely red quasars (ERQs), at
          redshifts 2 to 4, have been discovered in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
          matched to Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data. ERQs are defined by extremely red colors
          across rest-frame UV to mid-IR. They have a suite of extreme spectral properties that may all
          be related to exceptionally powerful quasar-driven outflows. </p>
      <p>I am a major contributor to the study of ERQs, together with Prof.
          <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/fhamann">Fred Hamann</a> (University of

          distributions of different quasar populations selected using different color and brightness
          criteria. ERQs have a distinct spectral energy distribution. Unlike some other red quasar
          populations or Type II active galactic nuclei which are steep in the rest UV, ERQs are flat
          in the rest UV despite being extremely red from rest UV to mid-IR. </p>

      <p><b>Probing the Inner Circumgalactic Medium and Quasar Illumination around the Reddest Extremely
          Red Quasar</b></p>
      <p>We present Keck/KCWI observations of the reddest known ERQ, at <i>z</i> = 2.3184, with
          extremely fast [OIII] 5007 outflow at ~6000 km/s. The Ly&alpha; halo spans ∼100 kpc. The
          halo is kinematically quiet, with velocity dispersion ∼300 km/s and no broadening above the
          dark matter circular velocity down to the spatial resolution ~6 kpc from the quasar. We detect
          spatially-resolved HeII 1640 and CIV 1549 emissions with kinematics similar to the
          Ly&alpha; halo and a narrow component in the [OIII] 5007. Quasar reddening acts as a
          coronagraph allowing views of the innermost halo. A narrow Ly&alpha; spike in the quasar
          spectrum is inner halo emission, confirming the broad CIV 1549 in the unresolved quasar is
          blueshifted by 2240 km/s relative to the halo frame. We propose the inner halo is dominated by
          moderate-speed outflow driven in the past and the outer halo dominated by inflow. The high
          central concentration of the surface brightness and the circularly symmetric morphology of the
          inner halo are consistent with the ERQ being in earlier evolutionary stage than blue quasars.
          The HeII 1640/Ly&alpha; ratio of the inner halo and the asymmetry level of the overall halo
          are dissimilar to Type II quasars, suggesting unique physical conditions for this ERQ that are
          beyond orientation differences from other quasar populations. We find no evidence of
          mechanical quasar feedback in the Ly&alpha;-emitting halo.</p>
      <p>The figures below show an optimally extracted image of the Ly&alpha; halo surrounding the
          reddest ERQ, a velocity centroid map of the Ly&alpha; flux, and a velocity dispersion map of
          the Ly&alpha; flux. In each figure a model of the quasar's point spread function has been
          subtracted. The plus symbol marks the position of the quasar. </p>

      <p><b>Probing Feeding and Feedback in the Circumgalactic Medium of Quasars Using Associated
          Absorbers</b> (Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 29 ID 16622; Cycle 25 ID 15034)</p>
      <p>Observations have shown a high incidence of highly ionized absorbers within several
          thousand km/s of the emission redshift of quasars, which are termed narrow associated
          absorption line systems. On the other hand, Quasars Probing Quasars observations of gas
          surrounding quasar-host galaxies in comparison to narrow associated absorbers on
          circumgalactic scales have found anisotropic ionizing radiation, which may translate to
          anisotropy in quasar feedback. While <i>z</i> >~ 2 narrow associated absorbers have been
          extensively surveyed in optical datasets, analyses at <i>z</i> <~ 1.5 have been limited
          to small samples with underutilized observational constraints. </p>
      <p>We are conducting an exhaustive, archival search of HI, CIV, NV, OVI narrow absorbers at
          velocity separation > -10000 km/s from the systemic redshift in <i>z</i> <~ 1.5 quasars.
          Our goal is to examine their physical conditions and statistical properties, using a
          sample of unprecedented size. We will assess their kinematics, chemical abundances,
          ionization states, and distances to the quasar hosts. We will assess correlation patterns
          among properties of associated absorbers and quasar luminosity. We will compare the
          line-of-sight circumgalactic medium to Quasars Probing Quasars results to assess quasar
          feedback. In contrast to the high-<i>z</i> universe, quasars at <i>z</i> <~ 1.5 have more
          precisely measured systemic redshifts, which will enable us to search for signs of
          coherent outflows and infalling gas, and separately analyze inflows for the first time.
          Moreover, the lower intergalactic opacity will allow much higher sensitivity to the far
          and extreme UV diagnostics. </p>
      <p>We will release a database of UV spectra cross-matched with optical spectra of the same
          quasars, with improved continuum fits and identifications of associated absorption lines.
          It will be distributed as part of <a href="https://github.com/specdb/igmspec">

            here</a>. QPQ is designed to examine gas related processes in the context of massive
        galaxy formation, as well as quasar feedback. The QPQ survey selects closely projected pairs

    <p><b>Quasars Probing Quasars: The Physical Properties of the Cool Circumgalactic Medium
        Surrounding <i>z</i> ~ 2-3 Massive Galaxies Hosting Quasars</b> </p>
    <p>We characterize the physical properties of the cool <i>T</i> &#8776; 10<sup>4</sup> K
        circumgalactic medium surrounding <i>z</i> ~ 2-3 quasar host galaxies, which are predicted
        to evolve into present day massive ellipticals. We use a statistical sample of 14 quasar
        pairs with projected separation < 300 kpc and spectra of high dispersion and high
        signal-to-noise ratio. We find extreme kinematics with low metal ion absorption line widths
        typically spanning 500 km/s, exceeding any previously studied galactic population. The
        circumgalactic medium is significantly enriched, even beyond the virial radius, with a
        median metallicity [M/H] = -0.6. The &alpha;/Fe abundance ratio is enhanced, suggesting that halo
        gas is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae. The projected cool gas mass within
        the virial radius is estimated to be 1.9&times;10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>&#8857;</sub>
        (<i>R</i><sub>&perp;</sub>/160 kpc)<sup>2</sup>, accounting for 1/3 of the baryonic budget of
        the galaxy halo. The ionization state of circumgalactic gas increases with projected
        distance from the foreground quasars, contrary to expectation if the quasar dominates the
        ionizing radiation flux. However, we also found peculiarities not exhibited in the
        circumgalactic medium of other galaxy populations. In one absorption system, we may be
        detecting unresolved fluorescent Ly&alpha; emission. Such anomaly suggest that
        transverse sightlines are&#8212;at least in some cases&#8212;possibly illuminated. We also
        discovered a peculiar case where detection of the CII* fine-structure line implies an
        electron density >100 cm<sup>-3</sup> and sub-parsec-scale gas clumps.</p>

    <p><b>Quasars Probing Quasars: The Kinematics of the Circumgalactic Medium Surrounding
        <i>z</i> ~ 2 Quasars</b> </p>
    <p> We examine the kinematics of the gas in the environments of galaxies hosting quasars
        at <i>z</i> ∼ 2. We employ 148 projected quasar pairs to study the circumgalactic gas of
        the foreground quasars in absorption. The sample selects foreground quasars with precise
        redshift measurements, using emission-lines with precision <= 300 km/s and average offsets
        from the systemic redshift <= |300 km/s|. We stack the background quasar spectra at the
        foreground quasar's systemic redshift to study the mean absorption in CII, CIV, and MgII.
        We find that the mean absorptions exhibit large velocity widths &sigma;<sub><i>v</i></sub>
        &#8776; 300 km/s. Further, we find that the mean absorptions appear to be asymmetric about
        the systemic redshifts. The mean absorption centroids exhibit small redshift relative to
        the systemic &delta;<i>v</i> = +200 km/s, with large intrinsic scatter in the centroid
        velocities of the individual absorption systems. We find the observed widths are consistent
        with gas in gravitational motion and Hubble flow. However, while the observation of large
        widths alone does not require galactic-scale outflows, the observed offsets suggest that
        the gas is on average outflowing from the galaxy. The observed offsets also suggest that
        the ionizing radiation from the foreground quasars is anisotropic and/or intermittent. </p>
    <p> The figure below shows the mean absorption centered at CII 1334, CIV 1548, and MgII 2796
        of the foreground quasars. Gaussian fits are overplotted. For the doublets, a second

    <p><b>Surface Abundance Variations of Red Giants in Globular Clusters</b></p>
    <p>The formation and evolution of galaxies can be probed via two techniques. First is through
        lookback studies, where one observes statistically the progenitors of present-day galaxies
        at high redshifts. Second is through studying present-day properties of galaxies, including
        their stellar populations, to learn about their past evolution. For high-redshift gas
        around galaxies, kinematics is easily measured, however chemical abundances require
        ionization modeling. For redshift-zero resolved stars, although they have lost the
        kinematic information at the time they formed, chemical abundances can be easily measured.
        The two techniques are thus complementary. Milky Way globular clusters have metallicities
        lower than high-redshift quasar systems, hence the stellar archeology approach using them
        pushes even further back in cosmic time. Although globular clusters are often used as fossil
        records, one must note they are not chemically homogeneous. </p>
    <p>In this project we study red giant stars in 27 Milky Way globular clusters. We test against
        the hypothesis that the surface abundance variations entirely come from pre-enriched gas,
        as opposed to evolutionary effects of the observed stars themselves. We find that, other
        than the prototype Messier 13 (Johnson & Pilachowski 2012), NGC 6388 also shows significant
        anti-correlation between the [O/Fe] ratio and stellar luminosity. Eight globular clusters
        show significant anticorrelation between [Na/Fe] ratio and stellar luminosity. Since the
        stars formed at about the same age, a dependence on luminosity translates to a dependence on
        stellar evolutionary stage. Bimodality possibly exists in [Na/Fe] distribution of several
        globular clusters. We have further observed oxygen-poor red giant stars in Messier 13 with
        Shane/Kast for the CN absorption band, to investigate CN correlation patterns with Na and O.
    </p>
    <p> The figure below shows surface [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] ratios for red giants in NGC 104. [Na/Fe]
        shows a positive dependence on stellar luminosity. </p>

        reproducing the observed dependence of quenched fractions of central and satellite galaxies
        on stellar mass and halo mass, as well as the observed stellar content in halos of different
        masses. </p>
    <p>The figure below shows the fraction of galaxies that are satellites as a function of stellar
        mass. The solid blue curve is computed from an SDSS-GALEX matched sample at <i>z</i> ~ 0.1
        obtained from Kimm et al. (2009). The dashed blue curve is the satllite fractions computed
        from our simulation outputs without halo quenching. The solid cyan curve is from the
        simulation outputs with halo quenching. </p>

    <p><b>Observation, Data Reduction, and Data Management</b></p>
    <p>I have been a service observer and data reductionist for a wide range of research topics.
        Topics include dusty absorbers toward quasars, active galactic nuclei reverberation mapping
        campaigns, spectroscopic redshifts of elliptical galaxies, and many others. I have observing
        experience in optical and near IR wavelengths, in long-slit spectroscopy, integral-field
        spectroscopy, imaging, and adaptive optics-assisted imaging and spectroscopy. I also manage
        databases of large sets of UV, optical, and near IR spectra of quasars and the softwares for
        accessing them. The above efforts are reflected in my co-authored
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#search/q=orcid%3A0000-0001-9755-9406&sort=date+desc">

    <p><b>Graduate Level and Above</b></p>
    <p>I work with graduate student
        <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/jgill016">Jarred Gillette</a> in his
        doctoral thesis at University of California, Riverside. We study the circumgalactic
        medium and illumination pattern of dusty quasars. We obtain hyperspectral imaging of the
        fluorescently illuminated gas haloes around dusty quasars using the
        <a href="https://www.keckobservatory.org/">Keck Observatory</a> 10-m Keck II telescope.
        Please ask Jarred for his latest results. </p>
    <p>If you want to hear me talking, here is a video tutorial about quasar absorption line
        fitting. I gave it at the <a href="https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/">Kavli Institute for
            Theoretical Physics</a> program of <a href="https://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/halo21/">

    <p><b>Undergraduate Level</b></p>
    <p>I led the undergraduate senior thesis of Mr.
        <a href="https://local.strw.leidenuniv.nl/people/pers.php?id=5415">Greg Sallaberry</a> at
        University of California, Santa Cruz, who is now a master student at Leiden University. The
        work is partially sponsored by the STEM diversity program
        <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/">LAMAT</a>, meaning star in Mayan. We work together
        on acquiring spectroscopic redshifts for massive elliptical galaxies using the
        <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org">Lick Observatory</a> 3-m Shane telescope. We then
        measure the fractions of galaxies that are satellites at the highest stellar masses. Below
        is a photo of Mr. Sallaberry presenting his excellent poster. </p>

    <p>I was a Teaching Assistant of eight different undergraduate astronomy and physics classes,
        under seven different instructors. My teaching philosophy is that, non-Western contributions
        in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science">history of science</a>
        should be introduced to students. In particular, I taught a class for introductory research
        experience for first-year and transfer students. I helped organize their research project
        groups and cooperative homework labs. Below is a photo of the final poster fair. </p>

    <p>I was a Teaching Assistant of the <a href="http://cosmos.ucsc.edu">California State Summer
        School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS)</a> of University of California Santa Cruz, over
        two summers. I led high school students on pre-scripted astronomy projects. The projects
        included eclipsing binaries, galactic rotation and redshift, color-magnitude diagram,
        color-color diagrams, and the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies. We also observed
        beautiful astronomical objects with the Lick Observatory 1-m Nickel telescope. Below is a
        card designed by my students. </p>

    <p>I led three high school interns under the <a href="https://sip.ucsc.edu/">Science Internship
        Program (SIP)</a> of University of California Santa Cruz, over two summers. We carried out a
        research project on the surface compositions of red giant stars in globular clusters.
        I advised them through the

<div class="tabcontent" id="Miscellaneous">
      <p>Prior to beginning a career in Astronomy, I participated in short research
        projects in various physical science disciplines. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> I worked on <b>Climate Change Sensitivity Evaluation from AIRS and IRIS
            Measurements</b>, with Prof. Yuk L. Yung in Caltech. I compared spectral data from
            two spaceborne instruments IRIS and AIRS that recorded Earth's outgoing radiation,
            which operated in 1970 and 2007 respectively. I then extracted greenhouse gas signals
            and showed the increase. The project resulted in an
            <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.892817">SPIE proceedings article</a>.
        <li> I worked on <b>Determining Cloud Base and Thickness from Spaceborne Stereoscopic
          Imaging and Lidar Profiling Techniques</b>, with Dr. Dong Wu in NASA Jet Propulsion
          Laboratory. I retrieved vertical structures of clouds from stereoscopic images taken by
          the spaceborne instrument MISR. I validated the results against ground based measurement
          data and showed excellent agreement. The results were published in the
          <a href="https://curj.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/curj_v12n2.pdf">Caltech Undergraduate
              Research Journal</a>.

          <img src="other_surf.png" style="width:60%;float;margin:1em 0em">
        <li> I studied <b>The Occurrence of High Winds and Severe Gusts during the Onset of
          Northeast Monsoon in Hong Kong</b>, in the Hong Kong Observatory. I found that there
          is no correlation between a rapid rate of change in atmospheric pressure gradient and the
          subsequent arrival of gusts at surface. The study is completed. Please contact me for a
          project report.
        <li> I studied <b>Mechanical Vibration of Thin Plates</b> for my senior thesis, with Prof.
          Kenneth Young in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Our approach is mathematical with
          no physical assumptions. The formulation through a power series expansion in wavenumber
          can be developed to high orders. Please contact me for a project report. A related
