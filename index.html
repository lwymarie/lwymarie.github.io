      <p><b>Extremely Dust-Reddened Quasars</b> </p>
      <p>Dust obscured quasars are believed to be in a young stage of quasar/galaxy evolution, where
        quasar feedback could be more important for driving blowouts and disrupting star formation in
        their host galaxies. Recently a remarkable population of luminous, extremely red quasars (ERQs),
        at redshifts 2 to 4, have been discovered in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
        matched to Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data. ERQs are defined by extremely red colors
        across rest UV to mid-IR. They have a suite of extreme spectral properties that may all be
        related to exceptionally powerful quasar driven outflows. </p>
      <p>I am a major contributor to the study of ERQs, together with Prof.
        <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/fhamann">Fred Hamann</a>

        wavelengths, with long-slit spectroscopy and integral field spectroscopy, to study their
        molecular, neutral, and ionized gas properties. </p>
      <p>The figure below is adopted from Hamann et al. (2017). It shows median spectral energy
         distributions of different quasar populations selected using different color and brightness
         criteria. Extremely red quasars have a distinct spectral energy distribution.
         Unlike some other red quasars or Type II active galactic nuclei which are
         steep in the rest UV, ERQs are flat in the rest UV despite being extremely red from rest UV to
         mid-IR. </p>

      <p><b>Extended Emission Around Extremely Red Quasars</b></p>
      <p>We have performed wide field integral field spectroscopy on a statistical sample of them.
         The reddest ERQ of all is the pilot study of the sample. Dust obscuration acts as a natural
         coronagraph, allowing views of the innermost halo region. Remarkably, the extended
         line-emitting halo is kinematically quiet despite the extreme outflows observed down the barrel
         to the quasar. Comparing with normal blue quasars reveals only marginal differences in the size,
         morphology, and flux distribution of the extended line-emitting halos. These findings have
         implications for feedback and evolution. Further, our results imply that for studies of large
         blueshifts in quasar spectra, the halo redshifts are good indicators of the systemic redshifts.
      </p>
      <p>The figure below shows an optimally extracted image of the Lyman-&alpha; halo surrounding the
        reddest ERQ, the velocity centroid map of the Lyman-&alpha; flux, and a velocity dispersion
        map of the Lyman-&alpha; flux. In each image a model of the quasar's point spread function has
        been subtracted. The cross symbol marks the position of the quasar and the diamond symbol marks
        the centroid of the nebula. </p>

      <p>I am a major contributor to (and largely concluded) the
        <a href="http://qpqsurvey.org">Quasars Probing Quasars survey</a>, together with Prof.
        <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~xavier">J. Xavier Prochaska</a> (UC Santa Cruz),

        I maintain the homepage, which has instructions for downloading the public
        database (please do). QPQ is
        designed to examine gas related processes in the context of massive galaxy formation, as
        well as quasar feedback. The QPQ survey selects closely projected pairs from SDSS and
        other surveys. To date, the sample comprises 700 pairs to within 1 Mpc separation. </p>
      <p>The figure on the right shows the experimental design of QPQ. Our line of sight
        to the background quasar is transverse to the foreground quasar, and intercepts its
        gaseous halo. Gas clumps transverse to the foreground quasar are largely un-illuminated by
        its ionizing radiation. </p>
      <p>The figure below shows an example background-foreground quasar pair. In the background
        quasar spectrum we see strong Lyman-&alpha; and metal ion absorption coincident with the
        foreground quasar's redshift. </p>

      <p><b>Quasars Probing Quasars. VIII. The Physical Properties of the Cool Circumgalactic
        Medium Surrounding <i>z</i> ~ 2-3 Massive Galaxies Hosting Quasars</b> </p>
      <p>We characterize the physical properties of the cool <i>T</i> &#8776;10<sup>4</sup> K
        circumgalactic medium surrounding <i>z</i> ~ 2-3 quasar host galaxies, which are predicted
        to evolve into present day massive ellipticals. Using a statistical sample of 14 quasar
        pairs with projected separation < 300 kpc and spectra of high dispersion and high
        signal-to-noise ratio, we find extreme kinematics with low metal ion lines typically
        spanning 500 km/s, exceeding any previously studied galactic population. The CGM is
        significantly enriched, even beyond the virial radius, with a median metallicity [M/H] =
        -0.6. The &alpha;/Fe abundance ratio is enhanced, suggesting that halo gas is primarily
        enriched by core-collapse supernovae. The projected cool gas mass within the virial radius
        is estimated to be 1.9&times;10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>&#8857;</sub>
        (<i>R</i><sub>&perp;</sub>/160 kpc)<sup>2</sup>,
        accounting for 1/3 of the baryonic budget of the galaxy halo. The ionization state of CGM
        gas increases with projected distance from the foreground quasars, contrary to expectation
        if the quasar dominates the ionizing radiation flux. However, we also found peculiarities
        not exhibited in the CGM of other galaxy populations. In one absorption system, we may be
        detecting unresolved fluorescent Lyman-&alpha; emission. Such anomaly suggest that
        transverse sightlines are&#8212;at
        least in some cases&#8212;possibly illuminated. We also discovered a peculiar case where
        detection of the CII* fine-structure line implies an electron density >100 cm<sup>-3</sup>
        and sub-parsec-scale gas clumps.</p>

      <p><b>Quasars Probing Quasars. IX. The Kinematics of the Circumgalactic Medium Surrounding
        z ~ 2 Quasars</b> </p>
      <p> We examine the kinematics of the gas in the environments of galaxies hosting quasars
        at z ∼ 2. We employ 148 projected quasar pairs to study the circumgalactic gas of the
        foreground quasars in absorption. The sample selects foreground quasars with precise
        redshift measurements, using emission-lines with precision <= 300 km/s and average offsets
        from the systemic redshift <= |300 km/s|. We stack the background quasar spectra at the
        foreground quasar's systemic redshift to study the mean absorption in CII, CIV, and MgII.
        We find that the mean absorptions exhibit large velocity widths &sigma;<sub><i>v</i></sub>
        &#8776;300 km/s. Further, we find that the mean absorptions appear to be asymmetric about
        the systemic redshifts. The mean absorption centroids exhibit small redshift relative to
        the systemic &delta;<i>v</i> = +200 km/s, with large intrinsic scatter in the centroid
        velocities of the individual absorption systems. We find the observed widths are consistent
        with gas in gravitational motion and Hubble flow. However, while the observation of large
        widths alone does not require galactic-scale outflows, the observed offsets suggest that
        the gas is on average outflowing from the galaxy. The observed offsets also suggest that
        the ionizing radiation from the foreground quasars is anisotropic and/or intermittent. </p>
      <p> The figure below shows the mean absorption centered at CII 1334, CIV 1548, and
        MgII 2796 of the foreground quasars. Gaussian fits are overplotted. For the doublets, a
        second Gaussian with a fixed mean separation and a tied standard deviation is included in
        the fits. The blue dashed lines mark the absorption centroids while the gray dashed lines

    <p><b>Surface Abundance Variations of Red Giants in Globular Clusters</b></p>
    <p>The formation and evolution of galaxies can be probed via two techniques. First is through
        lookback studies, where one observes statistically the progenitors of present-day galaxies
        at high redshifts. Second is through studying present-day properties of galaxies, including
        their stellar populations, to learn about their past evolution. For high-redshift gas
        around galaxies, kinematics is easily measured, however chemical abundances require
        ionization modeling. For redshift-zero resolved stars, although they have lost the
        kinematic information at the time they formed, chemical abundances can be easily measured.
        The two techniques are thus complementary. Milky Way globular clusters have metallicities
        lower than high-redshift quasar systems, hence the stellar archeology approach using them
        pushes even further back in cosmic time. Although globular clusters are often used as fossil
        records, one must note they are not chemically homogeneous. </p>
    <p>In this project we study red giants in 27 Milky Way globular clusters. We test against
        the hypothesis that the surface abundance variations entirely come from pre-enriched gas,
        as opposed to evolutionary effects of the observed stars themselves. We find that, other
        than the prototype Messier 13 (Johnson & Pilachowski 2012), NGC 6388 also shows significant
        anti-correlation between the [O/Fe] ratio and stellar luminosity. Eight globular clusters
        show significant anticorrelation between [Na/Fe] and stellar luminosity. Since the stars
        formed at about the same age, a dependence on luminosity translates to a dependence on
        stellar evolutionary stage. Bimodality possibly exists in [Na/Fe] distribution of several
        globular clusters. We have further observed oxygen-poor red giants in Messier 13 with
        Shane/Kast for the CN absorption band, to investigate correlation patterns with Na and O.
    </p>
    <p> The figure below shows surface [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] for red giants in NGC 104. [Na/Fe]
        shows a positive dependence on stellar luminosity. </p>

      <p><b>Observing AGN Feedback Down-the-barrel Using Associated Absorbers at
        <i>z</i> <~ 1.5 </b> (HST Cycle 25, ID 15034)</p>
      <p>Observations have shown a high incidence of highly ionized absorbers within several
        thousand km/s of the emission redshift of AGNs, which are termed narrow associated
        absorption line systems (NAALs). On the other hand, QPQ observations of gas surrounding
        quasar-host galaxies in comparison to NAALs on circumgalactic scales have found
        anisotropic ionizing radiation, which may translate to anisotropy in AGN feedback. While
        <i>z</i> >~ 2 NAALs have been extensively surveyed in optical datasets, analyses at
        <i>z</i> <~ 1.5 have been limited to small samples with underutilized observational
        constraints. </p>
      <p>We propose an exhaustive, archival search of HI, CIV, NV, OVI narrow absorbers at
        velocity separation > -10000 km/s from the systemic redshift in <i>z</i> <~ 1.5 AGNs. Our
        goal is to examine their physical conditions and statistical properties, using a sample of
        unprecedented size. We will assess their kinematics, chemical abundances, ionization
        states, and distances to the host AGN. We will assess correlation patterns among
        properties of NAALs and AGN luminosity. We will compare the line-of-sight circumgalactic
        medium to QPQ results to assess AGN feedback. In contrast to the high-<i>z</i> universe,
        AGNs at <i>z</i> <~ 1.5 have more precisely measured systemic redshifts, which will enable
        us to search for signs of coherent outflows and infalling gas, and separately analyze
        possible inflows for the first time. Moreover, the lower intergalactic opacity will allow
        much higher sensitivity to the far and extreme UV diagnostics. </p>
      <p>We will release a database of UV spectra cross-matched with optical spectra of the same
        AGNs, with improved continuum fits and identifications of associated absorption lines.
        It will be distributed as part of
        <a href="https://github.com/specdb/igmspec"><i>igmspec</i></a>. </p>
      <p>The figure below shows the experimental setup. The sightline to an AGN probes gas
        intrinsic to the AGN, as well as gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales. I propose to
        test the hypothesis that these absorbers are ionized and accelerated by the AGN. </p>

    <p>I work with graduate student
        <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/jgill016">Jarred Gillette</a> at
        University of California, Riverside in his doctoral thesis. We study the circumgalactic
        medium and illumination pattern of dusty quasars. We obtain hyperspectral imaging of the
        fluorescently illuminated gas haloes around dusty quasars using the
        <a href="https://www.keckobservatory.org/">Keck Observatory</a> 10-m Keck II telescope.
        Please ask Jarred for his latest results. </p>
    <p>I led the undergraduate senior thesis of Mr.
        <a href="https://local.strw.leidenuniv.nl/people/pers.php?id=5415">Greg Sallaberry</a> at
        University of California, Santa Cruz, who is now a master student at Leiden University. The
        work is partially sponsored by the STEM diversity program
        <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/">LAMAT</a>, meaning star in Mayan. We work together
        on acquiring spectroscopic redshifts for massive elliptical galaxies using the
        <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org">Lick Observatory</a> 3-m Shane telescope. We then
        measure the fractions of galaxies that are satellites at the highest stellar masses. Below
        is a photo of Mr. Sallaberry presenting his excellent poster. </p>

    <p>I was a Teaching Assistant of the <a href="http://cosmos.ucsc.edu">California State Summer
        School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS)</a> of University of California Santa Cruz, over
        two summers. I led high school students on pre-scripted astronomy projects. The projects
        included eclipsing binaries, galactic rotation and redshift, color-magnitude diagram,
        color-color diagrams, and the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies. We also observed
        beautiful astronomical objects with the Lick Observatory 1-m Nickel telescope. Below is a
        card designed by my students. </p>

    <p>I led three high school interns under the <a href="https://sip.ucsc.edu/">Science Internship
        Program (SIP)</a> of University of California Santa Cruz, over two summers. We carried out a
        research project on the surface compositions of red giant stars in globular clusters.
        I advised them through the
        <a href="https://www.competitionsciences.org/competitions/the-siemens-competition-in-math-science-technology/">
            Siemens Competition in Math, Science & Technology</a>. Below is a photo of my interns
        presenting the project. </p>
      <img src="SIP.jpg" style="width:50%;float">
    <p>I was a Teaching Assistant of eight different undergraduate astronomy and physics classes,
        under seven different instructors. In particular, I taught a class for introductory research
        experience for first-year and transfer students. I helped organize their research project
        groups and cooperative homework labs. Below is a photo of the final poster fair. </p>

    <p>My teaching philosophy is that, non-Western contributions in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science">history of science</a> should be
        introduced to students. </p>
    <p>I am first-generation high school, college, and PhD graduate. I have given private tutorials
        to other low-income children in Hong Kong. I taught Mathematics and English (as a second
        language). </p>

      <p>Prior to beginning a career in Astronomy, I participated in short research
        projects in various physical science disciplines. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> I worked on <b>Climate Change Sensitivity Evaluation from AIRS and IRIS
            Measurements</b>, with Prof. Yuk L. Yung in Caltech. I compared spectral data from
            two spaceborne instruments IRIS and AIRS that recorded Earth's outgoing radiation,
            which operated in 1970 and 2007 respectively. I then extracted greenhouse gas signals
            and showed the increase. The project resulted in an
            <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.892817">SPIE proceedings article</a>.
        <li> I worked on <b>Determining Cloud Base and Thickness from Spaceborne Stereoscopic
          Imaging and Lidar Profiling Techniques</b>, with Dr. Dong Wu in Jet Propulsion
          Laboratory. I retrieved vertical structures of clouds from stereoscopic images taken by
          the spaceborne instrument MISR. I validated the results against ground based measurement
          data and showed excellent agreement. The results were published in the
          <a href="https://curj.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/curj_v12n2.pdf">Caltech Undergraduate
              Research Journal</a>.
          <img src="other_surf.png" style="width:60%;float;margin:1em 0em">
        <li> I studied <b>The Occurrence of High Winds and Severe Gusts during the Onset of
          Northeast Monsoon in Hong Kong</b>, in the Hong Kong Observatory. I found that there
          is no correlation between a rapid rate of change in atmospheric pressure gradient and the
          subsequent arrival of gusts at surface. The study is completed. Please contact me for a
          project report.
        <li> I studied <b>Mechanical Vibration of Thin Plates</b> for my senior thesis, with Prof.
          Kenneth Young in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Our approach is mathematical with
          no physical assumptions. The formulation through a power series expansion in wavenumber
          can be developed to high orders. Please contact me for a project report. A related
          publication can be found
