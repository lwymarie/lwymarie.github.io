        <p><b>Quasars Probing Quasars. VIII. The Physical Properties of the Cool Circumgalactic 
        Medium Surrounding <i>z</i> ~ 2-3 Massive Galaxies Hosting Quasars</b> </p>
	<p>We characterize the physical properties of the cool <i>T</i> ~ 10<sup>4</sup> K 
        circumgalactic medium surrounding <i>z</i> ~ 2-3 quasar host galaxies, which are predicted 
        to evolve into present day massive ellipticals. Using a statistical sample of 14 quasar 
        pairs with projected separation < 300 kpc and spectra of high dispersion and high 
        signal-to-noise ratio, we find extreme kinematics with low metal ion lines typically 
        spanning 500 km/s, exceeding any previously studied galactic population. The CGM is 
        significantly enriched, even beyond the virial radius, with a median metallicity [M/H] = 
        -0.6. The &alpha;/Fe abundance ratio is enhanced, suggesting that halo gas is primarily 
        enriched by core-collapse supernovae. The projected cool gas mass within the virial radius 
        is estimated to be 
        1.9&times;10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>&#8857;</sub> 
        (<i>R</i><sub>&perp;</sub>/160 kpc)<sup>2</sup>, 
        accounting for 1/3 of the baryonic budget of the galaxy halo. The ionization state of CGM 
        gas increases with projected distance from the foreground quasars, contrary to expectation 
        if the quasar dominates the ionizing radiation flux. However, we also found peculiarities 
        not exhibited in the CGM of other galaxy populations. In one absorption system, we may be 
        detecting unresolved fluorescent Ly-&alpha; emission, and another system shows strong NV 
        lines. Taken together, these anomalies suggest that transverse sightlines are&#8212;at 
        least in some cases&#8212;possibly illuminated. We also discovered a peculiar case where 
        detection of the CII* fine-structure line implies an electron density >100 cm<sup>-3</sup> 
        and sub-parsec-scale gas clumps.</p>
        <p>The figure below shows the cumulative mass profiles of total H and metals in the cool

        <p><b>Quasars Probing Quasars. IX. The Kinematics of the Circumgalactic Medium Surrounding 
        z ~ 2 Quasars</b> </p>
        <p> We examine the kinematics of the gas in the environments of galaxies hosting quasars 
        at z âˆ¼ 2. We employ 112 projected quasar pairs to study the circumgalactic gas of the 
        foreground quasars in absorption. The sample selects foreground quasars with precise 
        redshift measurements, using emission-lines with precision <= 300 km/s and average offsets 
        from the systemic redshift <= |300 km/s|. We stack the background quasar spectra at the 
        foreground quasar's systemic redshift to study the mean absorption in CII, CIV, and MgII. 
        We find that the mean absorptions exhibit large velocity widths &sigma;<sub><i>v</i></sub> 
        > 300 km/s. The observed widths are consistent with gas in gravitational motion and Hubble 
        flow, and galactic-scale outflows are not required to explain the large widths. 
        Furthermore, we find that the mean absorptions are asymmetric about the systemic redshift. 
        The mean absorption centroids exhibit small redshift relative to the systemic 
        &delta;<i>v</i> = +200 km/s, with large intrinsic scatter in the centroid velocities of 
        the individual absorption systems. We show that the observed offsets may be produced if 
        (i) the ionizing radiation from the foreground quasars is anisotropic or intermittent; 
        (ii) the gas is not flowing into the galaxy. </p>
        <p> The figure below shows the mean absorption centered at CII 1334, CIV 1548, and 
        MgII 2796 of the foreground quasars. Gaussian fits are overplotted. For the doublets, a 
        second Gaussian with a fixed mean separation and a tied standard deviation is included in 
        the fits. </p>

	<p>Other than Quasars Probing Quasars, I am interested in the following. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Late Time Optical Spectral Signatures of Tidal Disruption Candidates</b> </p>
        <p>Quasars are short phases in galaxy evolution. If all galaxies host a massive black hole 
        at their center, the inactive massive black holes are hosted by ~95% of all galaxies. 
        Tidal disruption events are useful for studying inactive supermassive black holes. The 
        properties of the flare resulting from a disruption are dependent on black hole 
        properties. The motivation for this project is that TDEs are often not 
        followed-up beyond the first few years. We followed up 19 TDE candidates with 
        Shane/Kast from 2015 to 2016. </p>
        <p>The object PTF-09ge is of particular interest to us. The flare happened in 2009 and was 
        captured by Arcavi et al. (2014). The SDSS spectrum taken in 2003 shows no H&alpha; 
        emission. Our examination of their follow-up spectrum taken in 2013 reveals narrow 
        H&alpha; emission, which persists till 2015 in our follow-up spectra. </p>
        <p>The figure below shows the H&alpha;-[NII] region of PTF-09ge. Black is taken in 2003, 
        red is taken in 2013, and the blue and cyan are taken in 2015. For clarity we apply 
        constant offets to the fluxes. </p>

        <p><b>Na and O Abundance Anomalies in Globular Clusters: Internal Mixing or Primordial 
        Origin?</b></p>
        <p>The formation and evolution of galaxies can be probed via two techniques. First is 
        through lookback studies, where one observes statistically the progenitors of present 
        day galaxies at high redshifts. Second is through studying present 
        day properties of galaxies, including their stellar populations, to learn about their past 
        evolution. For high-redshift gas, kinematics is easily measured, such as in the Quasars 
        Probing Quasars survey. For stars, chemical abundances can be easily measured, although 
        they do not preserve fossil records of kinematics. The two techniques are thus 
        complementary. In particular, globular clusters typically have metallicities lower than 
        the systems studied in QPQ, hence the archeology approach pushes even further back in 
        redshift. However, globular clusters are not chemically homogeneous, in particular in 
        oxygen. Understanding oxygen variation thus becomes very important. </p>
        <p>In this project, we test the hypothesis that the variations are entirely primordial, as 
        opposed to stellar evolutionary effects. The figure below shows the [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] 
        ratios for red giant stars in the globular cluster NGC 104. [Na/Fe] shows a positive 
        dependence on stellar luminosity. </p>

        <p><b>Hydrodynamic Simulations of Specific Star Formation Rates at z ~ 0.1</b> </p>

        Kristian Finlator</a> 
        (New Mexico State University), we use hydrodynamic simulations to test whether the 
        properties of satellite galaxies are sensitive to models for quenching star formation in 
        central galaxies. We evaluate the success of a simple halo quenching model in reproducing 
        the observed dependence of quenched fractions of central and satellite galaxies on stellar 
        mass and halo mass, as well as the observed stellar content in halos of different masses. 
        </p>
        <p>The figure below shows the fraction of galaxies that are satellites as a function of 
        stellar mass. The solid blue curve is computed from an SDSS sample at <i>z</i> ~ 0.1 
        obtained from Kimm et al. (2009). The dashed blue curve is the satllite fractions computed 
        from our simulation outputs without halo quenching. The solid cyan curve is from the 
        simulation outputs with halo quenching. </p>
